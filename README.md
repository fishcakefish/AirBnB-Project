FishBn2B is an (attempted) clone of the website AirBnB, with my own style, gimmicks & beginner coding ability, using React Redux for my frontend. It features the usage of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Destroy) through "spots"; this platform being used to rent or rent out places for a short period of time. Authentication & User data is also another big feature.

Technologies Used:
    - React
    - Redux
    - Sqlite3

ToDo List:
    - Fix review delete and create minor bugs w/ refreshing
    - Better errors and handling
    - Implement bookings
    - Implement full CRUD for both reviews and bookings
    - Polish CSS
    - Far Future:
        - Successfully make a near-perfect clone of AirBnB

Get Started:
    In /backend:
        - npm install (fill stuff in)
        - npx dotenv sequelize db:m blah
    In /frontend:
        -npm install (find the right words)
    In both:
        -npm start
